# Title: Improving Project Management: A Case Study on Development of a Cutting-Edge Software Solution

## 1 Executive Summary:
### 1.1 Project Overview: 
In January 2024, our IT company started an ambitious project to deliver **cutting-edge software** with a target launch date on the first of June.
### 1.2 Key Issue: 
As the deadline **approaches**, issues were encountered such as incomplete tasks, unresolved bugs, and delayed testing process.

## 2 Recommendations for Improvement:
As a software engineer, there is not much recommendation to be made other than doing my part diligently and of quality. However, as someone involved the project here are my recommendations to the project manager.

But before that, I want to note that for this case study, recommendation are grouped into two: planning, and execution; which are 2 of the 4 phases of project development.
### 2.1.1 On Planning: Use Agile Methodology 
Choosing the proper methodology to begin with is crucial for the success of this project. For this particular case, I would suggest **Agile Methodology**. Because it is cutting-edge software, I think it would be better to delay extensive documentation and prioritize delivering the core features of the software first; then add new features incrementally after successful testing of the core functionalities, ensuring that each new addition is stable before proceeding.

 This, first and foremost, streamlined the development process, but also significantly reduces piling of unresolved bugs which only gets harder to troubleshoot as the system gets bigger.

### 2.1.2 On Planning: Set Realistic Project Timeline and Ensure Reasonable Load Distribution 
According to Kytainyk (2022), developing a software of average-complexity typically takes six to nine months; thus I think a mere six month for a cutting-edge software is not so realistic. It is important to ensure that deadlines are realistic and flexible - one that takes into consideration slack time for unforeseen events.

Also, every team member should not be overloaded with tasks to ensure that tasks are completed on time and with quality. 

### 2.1.3 On Planning: Strictly, Face-to-Face
The mode of development is also crucial. If it is imperative to finish the software within a short time frame, I think face-to-face setup is nonnegotiable. Compared with hybrid or remote setup, this provides a simpler communication and collaboration. For example, you could just walk up to your officemates and ask what could possibly be wrong with your code. Also, this sets the environment that is free from distractions usually present in our houses.

### 2.1.4 On Planning: Take Advantage of Collaboration Tools and Project Development Tools
For easier tracking of progress I would suggest to use project development tools such as Gantt Chart and/or Kanban Boards.  

### 2.2.1 On Execution: Conduct Daily Meetings
For a projects this big, constant communication is a must to ensure that everyone in the team are inlined with the overall project timeline. 

>This meeting should include the following:
- [x] Checking the progress of each member - to avoid uncompleted tasks.
- [x] Discussing technical problems encountered - to solve them early on and with the help of each other.
- [x] Addressing other concerns - to narrow down factors that might affect the development process. Sometimes, a team member's personal problem could get in the way of the work to be done.

With such meeting, the project manager could adjust the timeline accordingly and proceed with actions to address delays and issues. For example, if the team is unable to meet deadlines, he or she could consider outsourcing certain tasks to external experts, reallocate human resources or simply adjust the deadlines.

### 2.2.1 On Execution: Conduct Regular Unit Test
Regular unit tests means testing of independent components in contrast to system testing which is a test for these components integrated as a system(GeeksforGeeks, 2023). This not only simplify testing but also helps in identifying and resolving bugs early, ensuring a more stable product.
